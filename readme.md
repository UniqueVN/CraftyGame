This is an html5 game created using Crafty engine: http://craftyjs.com/

The game is about a Taoist monk walked into a town infested by ghosts. And now it's his duty to exorcise them and cleansing this corrupted place.

It's based on dota game type, but adding dynamically generated map and randomly spawned enemy waves. You can breed your minions to counter the ghost wave, craft powerful artifacts from heaven while seeking to reveal the true nature behind this incident.
